# Nimbus
Welcome to Nimbus project! This ambitious endeavor aims to create a streamlined, clutter-free, and highly accessible personal cloud storage solution. Imagine a single place where you can drop any file, message, note, app, or voice transcript from your PC and instantly access it from your phone, without worrying about network configurations or traditional login hassles.

This hub is designed just for you, prioritizing simplicity and privacy over complex sharing features. Your data will be meticulously organized into intuitive sections (texts, images, apps, etc.), and access will be granted via a unique, secure 6-digit passcode, ensuring your digital life is always in sync and at your fingertips.

Features
The Personal Hub is being built with the following core functionalities in mind:

Universal Content Support: Upload and manage any type of digital content â€“ from documents and images to voice notes and application files.
Seamless Cross-Device Access: Access your entire digital library from your PC and mobile device effortlessly, similar to cloud storage but without the clutter.
Intuitive Organization: Content is automatically or manually categorized into distinct sections (e.g., Texts, Images, Apps, Voice Transcripts) for easy navigation.
Passcode-Based Security: A unique, private 6-digit passcode acts as your key to retrieve and synchronize all your data, moving away from cumbersome username/password credentials.
Real-time Synchronization: Ensures your data is always up-to-date across all your connected devices.
Self-Hosted Control: You maintain full control over your data, as it resides on your own server.
Technologies Used (Under Development)
The project is currently being built using the following technologies:

Backend (Server-Side)
Python: The primary language for the server logic.
Flask: A lightweight and powerful Python web framework for building the API.
SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for interacting with the database.
SQLite: (Initial choice) A simple, file-based relational database for easy setup and development. This may be upgraded to PostgreSQL for more robust production environments.
Local File System: For storing the actual uploaded files.
Frontend (Client-Side)
PC Application: (Planned) Potentially built with Python (PyQt/Tkinter) or Electron for a desktop interface.
Mobile Application: (Planned) Likely developed using React Native for cross-platform (iOS/Android) compatibility.
Getting Started (Development Setup)
This section will be populated as the project progresses and the core functionalities are established. It will include instructions on:

Setting up the backend server.
Running the PC application (once developed).
Running the mobile application (once developed).
